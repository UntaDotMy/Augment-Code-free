## Installation

### Method 1: Download Executable (Recommended)

1. Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/UntaDotMy/Augment-Code-free/releases) page
2. Choose the version for your system:
   - Windows: `AugmentFree_latest.exe`
   - Linux: `AugmentFree_latest` (Linux)
   - macOS: `AugmentFree_latest` (macOS)
3. Extract and run the corresponding executable

### Method 2: Run from Source

1. Ensure you have a suitable Python version installed
2. Clone this repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UntaDotMy/Augment-Code-free.git
   cd Augment-Code-free
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Using uv (recommended)
   uv sync

   # Or using pip
   pip install -e .
   ```

### Method 3: Build Executable

If you want to build the executable yourself:

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies (see Method 2)
2. Install build dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Using uv
   uv sync --extra build

   # Or using pip
   pip install pyinstaller pillow
   ```
3. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   # Using Python script (recommended)
   python build.py

   # Windows users can also use
   build.bat
   ```
4. After building, the executable will be in the `dist/` directory

### Method 4: Automatic Versioning & Release System

The project supports intelligent automatic version management and releasing:

#### **ü§ñ Automatic Version Detection (Recommended)**:
The system automatically determines version type based on commit messages:
- **Major version (+1.0.0)**: Commits containing `BREAKING`, `major`, `breaking change`
- **Minor version (+0.1.0)**: Commits containing `feat`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `add`, `new`
- **Patch version (+0.0.1)**: Other commits (bug fixes, etc.)

```bash
# Just commit normally, system handles versioning automatically
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new smart detection feature"
git push origin main
# System automatically creates v1.1.0 release
```

#### **üìã Manual Version Release**:
```bash
# Use release script (recommended)
python scripts/release.py

# Windows users
scripts/release.bat

# Or manually create tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

#### **üéØ GitHub Actions Manual Trigger**:
1. Go to GitHub repository ‚Üí **Actions**
2. Select **"Auto Release"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Choose version type (major/minor/patch)
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

#### **üìä Version Number Rules**:
- **v1.0.0** ‚Üí **v2.0.0** (Major): Breaking changes, major updates
- **v1.0.0** ‚Üí **v1.1.0** (Minor): New features, enhancements
- **v1.0.0** ‚Üí **v1.0.1** (Patch): Bug fixes, small changes

#### **üéØ Commit Message Examples**:
```bash
# Major version update
git commit -m "BREAKING: redesign entire UI system"

# Minor version update
git commit -m "feat: add VS Code Insiders support"
git commit -m "enhancement: improve path detection"

# Patch version update
git commit -m "fix: resolve copy button issue"
